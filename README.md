**By** _Tharaa Elmorssi_

This excercise demonstrates how to create a mobile friendly web site that is responsive on any device.
Web Foundations - Project 2 - Build a Portfolio Site

I was commited to the colours provided in the site mockup, but to the same design.

I built up this site from scratch using HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, JQuery, in addition to responsive images and responsive flexbox techniques.

The minimum screen width this site is tested to is 320px.
